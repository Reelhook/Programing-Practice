### Chapter 3 "Devices"
- Device Files
	- Block devices
		- Programs access data from a block device in fixed chunks. The sda1 in
			the preceding example is a disk device, a type of block device. Disks can
			be easily split up into blocks of data. Because a block device‚Äôs total size
			is fixed and easy to index, processes have quick random access to any
			block in the device with the help of the kernel.
	- Character device
		- Character devices work with data streams. You can only read characters
			from or write characters to character devices, as previously demonstrated
			with /dev/null. Character devices don‚Äôt have a size; when you read from or
			write to one, the kernel usually performs a read or write operation on it.
			Printers directly attached to your computer are represented by character
			devices. It‚Äôs important to note that during character device interaction,
			the kernel cannot back up and reexamine the data stream after it has
			passed data to a device or process.
	- Pipe device
		- Named pipes are like character devices, with another process at the other
			end of the I/O stream instead of a kernel driver.
	- Socket deviceImportant dd options
		- Sockets are special-purpose interfaces that are frequently used for
			interprocess communication. They‚Äôre often found outside of the /dev
			directory. Socket files represent Unix domain sockets; you‚Äôll learn more
			about those in Chapter 10.
- dd and devices
	- if=file
		- The input file. The default is the standard input.
	- of=file
		- The output file. The default is the standard output.
	- bs=size‚ÄÇ
		- The block size. dd reads and writes this many bytes of data at a
