## Crockpot Tuscan Chicken

This Crockpot Tuscan Chicken is made up juicy chicken breasts slow cooked in a rich and cheesy cream sauce. This recipe takes just 10 minutes to prep and makes the perfect dinner served over your favorite pasta!
 

### Notes

*Serving size will vary depending on the weight of the chicken breasts used.¬†

**Some sauce was removed from the slow cooker to show detail.

**Substitutions**:

- You can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I would aim for 2 lbs of meat.
- You can use a lighter cream, but keep in mind that the sauce will not be as thick and rich (you may want to increase the corn starch to compensate)
- Try swapping the sun dried tomatoes for roasted red peppers or the fresh spinach for kale if that‚Äôs what you have on hand.

**Leftovers**

Leftover Crockpot Tuscan Chicken will last in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days or in the freezer for 2-3 months. To reheat, thaw overnight in the fridge if frozen, then warm on the stove or in the oven until heated through.

**To thaw chicken before cooking**:

To quickly thaw frozen chicken, place it in a bowl of cool water and allow it to sit until thawed. Change the water out every 20 minutes so that it doesn‚Äôt get too warm.
